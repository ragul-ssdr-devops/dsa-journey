# DSA Journey – Python

This repository documents my structured journey in mastering Data Structures
and Algorithms using Python, with a focus on:

- Pattern-based problem solving
- Optimization and time-space tradeoffs
- Clear explanations and dry runs
- Reusable logic over memorization

## Learning Approach
- Each problem includes:
  - Brute force solution
  - Optimized approach
  - Dry run explanation
  - Complexity analysis
- Problems are grouped by patterns, not randomly

## Long-Term Goal
- Strong problem-solving foundation
- Transition into Developer → DevOps roles
- Apply DSA concepts to real systems (APIs, caching, monitoring)

## Topics Covered
- Arrays & Hashing (in progress)
	- LC#1 - Two Sum - O(n)
